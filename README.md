Ramcrest: a Ruby port of Hamcrest [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hamcrest/ramcrest.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hamcrest/ramcrest)
---------------------------------

Hamcrest is a powerful set of classes and functions that allow building
up complicated matching expressions. The matchers provide useful descriptions
of what they are trying to match, as well as a description of why a particular
object is not matched (a mismatch description).

The tests for the various matchers should provide great examples of usage because
each matcher is actually tested using the Ramcrest framework.
